## TypeScript Reference Guide

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding static typing, interfaces, and modern features to enhance scalability and maintainability. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript. TypeScript compiles down to JavaScript, making it compatible with browsers and Node.js environments.

### Why Was TypeScript Created?

JavaScript was originally designed for simple web scripting but has grown into a widely used language for large-scale applications. However, as projects grew in complexity, JavaScriptâ€™s dynamic typing led to bugs and maintainability issues. TypeScript was created by Microsoft to address these challenges by introducing static types, better tooling, and improved developer experience.

### Use Cases of TypeScript

TypeScript is used in a variety of scenarios, including:

- Large-Scale Applications: Helps teams manage complex codebases with type safety and modularity.

- Frontend Development: Popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue support TypeScript.

- Backend Development: Works seamlessly with Node.js for building scalable APIs and services.

- Library and Package Development: Ensures better documentation and usability of shared modules.

- Enterprise-Level Applications: Improves collaboration by enforcing consistent coding standards.
