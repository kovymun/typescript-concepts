/* Introduction to TypeScript */

/**
 * Traditionally, JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language, meaning type and error checking occur at runtime when the program executes.
 * TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing.
 * One key benefit of static typing is that it allows developers to catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.
 * This helps developers by reducing bugs, improving code maintainability, and making refactoring safer.
